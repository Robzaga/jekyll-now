A lot of the work I have done in school and work has been focused on C++ and C#. Some of my favorite courses I have taken have been in **Advanced High Performance Computer Architecture**, **Embedded Systems 1 & 2** and **Senior Design Project**. Go [here](projects.md) to read more about some of my favorite projects. 


# Personal

My wife and I own a home in American Fork where it's close to family and fun. We have a two year old daughter who we spend most of our free time with making memories and giggling. We love to spend time with grandparents, feed the ducks, swim at the pool, play at the park, beat our bowling scores, keep up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and staying in touch with good friends. We're super excited that Spring is here so we can do more outside activities.
In my own spare time I like to exercise and fix things around the house. I try a few DIY projects a year in different categories; My latest project was painting the car doors I bought from the Junk Yard to replace the doors someone hit on accident. I learn a lot from each project and the principle relearned in each is to be patient and take your time to do it right. 
I have a goal to go back to school to get my Masters degree and I would like to start on that within the next two years. I am still deciding which progrm to pursue but I am leaning towards Computer Science because the classes I would be taking seem very interesting and helpful for my professional career.
